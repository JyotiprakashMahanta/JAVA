/**
 * COMPARATOR
 * ===========
 * It is an Interface which is present in  java.util package.
 * Which is consist a abstract() method called compare which help the developer to perform dynamic sorting
 * i.e user define sorting.
 * 
 *  syntax:
 *  ---------
 *  public int compare (Object o1,Object o2){
 *  	return 1;
 *  }
 *  
 *  To perform user defined sorting we should create helper class for each sorting option.
 *  
 *   Every helper classes must be implemented comprartor Interface and should override with compare() 
 *   with following case.
 *   
 *   case-1
 *   Object 1 property> Object 2 property (it return positive integer).
 *   case-2
 *   Object 1 property < Object 2 property (it return negative integer).
 *   case-3
 *   Object 1 property == Object 2 property then it returns zero as a integer.
