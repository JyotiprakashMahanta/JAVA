Some people just want something to copy and paste. Maybe you are just showing an intermediate step, or the source code is enough. (For example, the article is for an advanced audience, and they just need to see the code.) Also, you might be demonstrating an API feature that doesn't work well as an embedded example, which might need its own separate page to link to.
The interactive examples are great as readers can modify values on the fly â€” this is very valuable for learning. However, they are more complex to set up than the other forms, with more limitations, and are intended for specific purposes.
Traditional live samples are useful if you want to show source code on a page, then show it running, and you're not that bothered about it being accessible as a standalone example. This approach also has the advantage that if you are showing source code and live examples side by side, you only need to update the code once to update both. They can however be awkward to edit and get working.
GitHub live samples are useful when you've got an existing example you want to embed, don't want to show the source code for, and/or you want to make sure the example is available in standalone form. They have a better contribution workflow, but it does require you to know GitHub. Also because on-page code and source code are in two different places, it is easier for them to get out of sync.");
